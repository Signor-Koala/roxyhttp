# RoxyHTTP

_A simple HTTP server written in C, and extensible through Lua_

---

## About
A (very) simple HTTP server written in C designed to simple to use and deploy in POSIX systems.

By default it simply serves files in a provided directory. This functionality can be overridden by 
functions that directly process the request and produce a response, which is done in plain Lua.

This project is currently mostly incomplete and has many rough edges.

## Prerequisites
- cmake >= 3.10
- lua 5.4
- \<add others here\>

## Setup
TODO!

Have to test systems other than Arch

## Usage
TODO!
